## :calling: About

YumMeals is an online food ordering app that resembles a simpler version of similar modern large-scale apps such as [Uber Eats](https://www.ubereats.com/ 'Uber Eats') and [DoorDash](https://www.doordash.com/ 'DoorDash'). Core features include location searching with city names, which displays a list of restaurants found within the search results vicinity, along with user register/login authentication, a settings screen with customizable user avatar and the option to store restaurant(s) as favourites.

The app also comes with an ordering and payment feature which utilizes services from the Stripe API. Users can place orders from the restaurant menu and add them to the cart before checking out. The user interface for the payment input field, with a minimalist design, can be found alongside the cart summary for easy reference to the user's order summary during the checkout process.

The integrated Stripe payment service accepts any valid debit/ credit card. However, since this isn't a fully published production app, the payment feature is set to testing mode to mimic a real-life payment flow. For this, Stripe has provided a list of sample payment card details for testing purposes that users can use to make payments in this app.

### :bangbang: IMPORTANT! - _Note for iOS users_

Unfortunately, iOS users will not be able to preview the published app hosted on Expo. This issue is due to restrictions imposed by Apple and not by Expo itself.

Please refer to this Expo documentation link for further information on this restriction:

- Link: https://docs.expo.io/workflow/publishing/#on-ios-you-cant-share-your-published

Due to the nature of this project objective being an educational and experimental one in learning more about working with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/ 'React Native') and the [Expo](https://expo.io/ 'Expo') framework in a production-like environment mimicking a professional workflow, this app isn't built for distributing officially to either the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store 'Google Play Store') or the [App Store](https://www.apple.com/app-store/ 'App Store').

For this, please refer to the app screenshots below. A mixture of both screenshot pictures and GIFs is provided as an alternative for previewing the app.
